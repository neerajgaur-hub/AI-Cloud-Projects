# CI/CD Best Practices for Machine Learning Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) enable efficient, automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models. This cheat sheet highlights best practices for implementing CI/CD pipelines using cloud-native tools like Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, and GitHub Actions.

## Key Features
- **Automated Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks, including model training and deployment.
- **Version Control**: Ensure reproducibility by tracking code, data, and model versions.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy models with monitoring to ensure performance consistency.

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Control Everything
- Use Git for tracking code, configuration files, and model training scripts.
- Track datasets and model artifacts with tools like DVC or cloud storage metadata.

### 2. Automate Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of your ML pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing).
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure model training scripts work end-to-end.
- **Model Validation**: Include metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to validate models during CI.

#### Example: Python Unit Test
```python
import unittest
from preprocessing import preprocess_data

class TestPreprocessing(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_preprocess(self):
        raw_data = ["example data"]
        processed = preprocess_data(raw_data)
        self.assertEqual(len(processed), 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### 3. Use Modular Pipelines
- Break pipelines into stages: data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- Use tools like MLflow or Kubeflow for modular workflows.

### 4. Automate Deployment
- Deploy models to staging environments for testing before production.
- Use tools like Azure Machine Learning Endpoints or SageMaker Endpoints for deployment.

#### Example: Deploying to Staging with SageMaker
```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = sagemaker.create_endpoint_config(
    EndpointConfigName='staging-config',
    ProductionVariants=[{
        'ModelName': 'my-model',
        'InstanceType': 'ml.m5.large',
        'InitialInstanceCount': 1
    }]
)

print("Endpoint deployed to staging")
```

### 5. Monitor Performance
- Use monitoring tools like Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, or Prometheus to track model performance and pipeline health.
- Set alerts for model drift, latency issues, and prediction errors.

### 6. Secure Your Pipeline
- Store sensitive data like API keys in secret management tools (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Restrict IAM permissions to pipeline stages.

## CI/CD Tools
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines**: Great for end-to-end workflows.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Ideal for integrating ML models into AWS ecosystems.
- **GitHub Actions**: Flexible, GitHub-native CI/CD solution.
- **MLflow**: Open-source tool for tracking experiments and deployments.

**Pro Tip**: Use event-driven triggers (e.g., code commits or dataset updates) to initiate your CI/CD pipelines automatically for efficient workflows.
