# AI Model Deployment Strategies Cheat Sheet

## Overview
This cheat sheet outlines common strategies for deploying AI models, including APIs, batch jobs, and real-time inference. Each deployment method serves specific use cases, and this guide provides best practices for selecting and implementing the right strategy.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. APIs for Real-Time Inference
- **Use Case**: Low-latency applications such as chatbots, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes one request at a time.
  - Ideal for dynamic, user-facing services.
- **Tools**:
  - **Azure**: Azure Machine Learning Endpoints.
  - **AWS**: SageMaker Endpoints, API Gateway + Lambda.

#### Example: Deploying an API with Azure ML
```bash
az ml endpoint create --name my-endpoint --model my-model \
  --resource-group <resource-group> --workspace-name <workspace>
```

#### Example: Deploying an API with SageMaker
```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')
response = sagemaker.create_endpoint(
    EndpointName='my-endpoint',
    EndpointConfigName='my-endpoint-config'
)
print("Endpoint deployed!")
```

### 2. Batch Jobs
- **Use Case**: Processing large datasets periodically, such as generating reports or updating recommendations.
- **Key Features**:
  - Processes multiple inputs simultaneously.
  - Ideal for non-time-sensitive tasks.
- **Tools**:
  - **Azure**: Azure Batch, Azure ML Pipelines.
  - **AWS**: SageMaker Batch Transform.

#### Example: Batch Transform with SageMaker
```python
from sagemaker import Session

session = Session()
batch_job = session.transform(
    model_name='my-model',
    input_data='s3://my-bucket/input-data',
    content_type='text/csv',
    split_type='Line',
    output_path='s3://my-bucket/output-data'
)
print("Batch job started!")
```

### 3. Edge Deployment
- **Use Case**: Deploy models on devices with limited internet connectivity, such as IoT devices or mobile phones.
- **Key Features**:
  - Offline inference.
  - Optimized for low power and compute environments.
- **Tools**:
  - **Azure**: Azure IoT Edge, ONNX Runtime.
  - **AWS**: AWS IoT Greengrass, SageMaker Edge Manager.

#### Example: Edge Deployment with Azure IoT Edge
```json
{
  "modulesContent": {
    "$edgeAgent": {
      "properties.desired": {
        "modules": {
          "modelModule": {
            "settings": {
              "image": "<acr-path>/model-image:latest"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### General Recommendations
1. **Monitor Performance**: Use tools like Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch to track model latency and throughput.
2. **Version Control**: Maintain versions for models and deployment configurations.
3. **Secure APIs**: Implement authentication and rate limiting for API-based deployments.

### For APIs
- Scale horizontally with Kubernetes or auto-scaling services.
- Cache responses for common queries to reduce latency.

### For Batch Jobs
- Optimize I/O operations for large datasets.
- Schedule jobs during off-peak hours to reduce costs.

### For Edge Deployment
- Quantize models to reduce size and improve inference speed.
- Periodically sync models with cloud repositories for updates.
