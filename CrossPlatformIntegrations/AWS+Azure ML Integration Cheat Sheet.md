# AWS Rekognition + Azure Machine Learning Integration Cheat Sheet

## Overview
This guide demonstrates how to integrate AWS Rekognition with Azure Machine Learning to combine the strengths of both platforms for computer vision tasks. AWS Rekognition handles image and video analysis, while Azure ML is used for advanced model training and deployment.

---

## Key Features of the Integration
- **AWS Rekognition:** Performs object detection, face recognition, and text extraction from images and videos.
- **Azure Machine Learning:** Trains and deploys custom machine learning models.
- **Hybrid Cloud Workflow:** Enables seamless data sharing and processing between AWS and Azure.
- **Scalability:** Leverages the best services from each cloud to create robust solutions.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up AWS Rekognition
- Create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload your images or videos.
- Ensure the S3 bucket has the necessary permissions for Rekognition to access the files.
- Use the AWS Rekognition API to process images or videos and extract insights.

#### Example Code for AWS Rekognition
```python
import boto3

# Initialize Rekognition client
rekognition = boto3.client('rekognition')

response = rekognition.detect_labels(
    Image={
        'S3Object': {
            'Bucket': 'my-bucket',
            'Name': 'my-image.jpg'
        }
    },
    MaxLabels=10,
    MinConfidence=75
)

print(response['Labels'])
```

### 2. Set Up Azure Machine Learning
- Create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace.
- Set up a compute instance for running your ML experiments.
- Import the AWS Rekognition output data into Azure ML for further processing.

#### Example Code for Data Import to Azure ML
```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

# Connect to your Azure ML workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Create a dataset from Rekognition output stored in S3
dataset = Dataset.File.from_files(path=["https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/my-output-data/"])

# Register the dataset in Azure ML
dataset.register(workspace=ws, name='rekognition_output')
```

---

### 3. Process Rekognition Data in Azure ML
- Use Azure ML to train and evaluate a machine learning model with Rekognition output.

#### Example Code for Training a Model
```python
from azureml.core import Experiment

# Create an experiment in Azure ML
experiment = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='rekognition-integration')

# Define your training script and configuration
config = ScriptRunConfig(
    source_directory='./scripts',
    script='train.py',
    compute_target='my-compute-instance'
)

# Submit the experiment
run = experiment.submit(config)
run.wait_for_completion()
```

---

### 4. Deploy the Model
- Use Azure ML endpoints to deploy your trained model.
- Connect the endpoint to an application or service for real-time predictions.
