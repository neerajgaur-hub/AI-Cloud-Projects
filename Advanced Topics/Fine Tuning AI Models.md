# Fine-Tuning AI Models Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Fine-tuning AI models involves training pre-trained models on domain-specific data to improve their performance for specific tasks. This cheat sheet covers the steps, tools, and best practices for fine-tuning models on Azure OpenAI and AWS SageMaker.

## Key Steps for Fine-Tuning

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Clean and Preprocess Data**: Ensure data is well-labeled and formatted.
- **Split Data**: Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Tokenization**: Tokenize text data to match the input format of the model (e.g., GPT or BERT).

#### Example: Tokenization with Hugging Face
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt-3")
data = "Your training data here."
tokens = tokenizer(data, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
```

### 2. Choose a Pre-Trained Model
- **Azure OpenAI**: Use models like GPT-3, Codex, or DALLÂ·E.
- **AWS SageMaker**: Leverage pre-trained models from JumpStart or Hugging Face.

## Fine-Tuning on Azure OpenAI

### Steps
1. **Create an Azure OpenAI Resource**:
   - Log in to the Azure portal and create an OpenAI instance.
2. **Upload Training Data**:
   - Format data as JSONL and upload it to Azure Blob Storage.
3. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
   - Use the Azure CLI or SDK to initiate fine-tuning.

#### Example: Fine-Tune GPT-3
```bash
az openai fine-tunes create --resource-group my-group \
  --workspace-name my-workspace --model gpt-3 --data-file training-data.jsonl
```

## Fine-Tuning on AWS SageMaker

### Steps
1. **Prepare a Dataset**:
   - Upload training data to an S3 bucket.
2. **Choose a Pre-Trained Model**:
   - Use a Hugging Face model from SageMaker JumpStart.
3. **Launch a Training Job**:
   - Use SageMaker Training Jobs to fine-tune the model.

#### Example: Fine-Tune a Hugging Face Model
```python
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFace

huggingface_estimator = HuggingFace(
    entry_point='train.py',
    source_dir='./scripts',
    instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge',
    instance_count=1,
    role='your-role-arn',
    transformers_version='4.6',
    pytorch_version='1.7',
    py_version='py36',
)

huggingface_estimator.fit({"train": "s3://your-bucket/training-data/"})
```

## Best Practices

### General Recommendations
1. **Use Domain-Specific Data**: Ensure your dataset reflects the task the model will perform.
2. **Monitor Overfitting**: Regularly evaluate on a validation set to avoid overfitting.
3. **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs.
4. **Use Transfer Learning**: Start with a pre-trained model to reduce training time and cost.

### For Azure OpenAI
- Use **batch jobs** for large datasets to avoid hitting rate limits.
- Test the fine-tuned model with diverse inputs to ensure robustness.

### For AWS SageMaker
- Leverage **Spot Instances** for cost-effective training.
- Enable **Debugging and Profiling** in SageMaker to monitor training.
