# Federated Learning Frameworks on the Cloud Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning models across multiple devices or organizations while preserving data privacy. This cheat sheet explores how to implement FL frameworks on **Azure** and **AWS**, with best practices and examples.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Decentralized Training**: Train models on data stored across devices or locations without moving data to a central server.
- **Privacy Preservation**: Ensure sensitive data remains secure using differential privacy or secure aggregation techniques.
- **Model Aggregation**: Combine locally trained models into a global model.

---

## Supported Frameworks
- **TensorFlow Federated (TFF)**: A framework for FL experiments with TensorFlow.
- **PySyft**: An open-source library for privacy-preserving ML.
- **Amazon Sagemaker Edge Manager**: AWS solution for federated learning on edge devices.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Azure Federated Learning with Custom Frameworks
#### Steps:
1. Set up an **Azure Machine Learning** workspace.
2. Deploy **Virtual Machines (VMs)** or **Kubernetes clusters** for distributed training.
3. Use TensorFlow Federated or PySyft to coordinate training jobs.

#### Example Code: Model Aggregation in TFF
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define a simple model
def create_model():
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(28, 28))
    ])

# Federated training process
iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
    model_fn=create_model
)
state = iterative_process.initialize()
```

### 2. AWS Federated Learning with SageMaker
#### Steps:
1. Use **AWS SageMaker** for global model orchestration.
2. Deploy **SageMaker Edge Manager** for device-side training.
3. Aggregate models using AWS Lambda or SageMaker Processing.

#### Example Code: Federated Model Update with SageMaker
```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')
response = sagemaker.create_model(
    ModelName='federated-global-model',
    PrimaryContainer={
        'Image': '<ecr-image-url>',
        'ModelDataUrl': 's3://<bucket>/model.tar.gz'
    },
    ExecutionRoleArn='<execution-role-arn>'
)
print("Global model updated!")
```

## Best Practices

### General Recommendations
1. **Encrypt Data**: Use encryption for model parameters and gradients during transmission.
2. **Monitor Training Jobs**: Track resource usage and training progress using Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch.
3. **Optimize Bandwidth Usage**: Compress model updates to reduce communication overhead.

### Azure
- Leverage **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** for scalable, distributed workloads.
- Use **Azure Key Vault** for managing secure keys and secrets.

### AWS
- Use **IAM Roles** to control access to sensitive resources.
- Enable **CloudWatch Alarms** to detect anomalies in training.
